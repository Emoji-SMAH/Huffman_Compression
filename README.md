# Huffman_Compression
Huffman Coding is a fundamental data compression technique used in various applications to reduce the size of data files efficiently. This Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project aims to implement the Huffman Coding algorithm from scratch, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying concepts in data compression.

Project Objectives:
Algorithm Understanding:
Thoroughly understand the Huffman Coding algorithm, its principles, and how it assigns variable-length codes to characters based on their frequencies.
Data Structures:
Implement the necessary data structures, such as binary trees (for building the Huffman tree) and priority queues (for efficient node manipulation).
Encoding:
Develop the encoding process, which involves creating the Huffman tree from character frequency data and generating the corresponding Huffman codes.
Decoding:
Implement the decoding process to recover the original data from the Huffman-encoded binary stream, using the Huffman tree built during encoding.
User Interface:
Create a user-friendly command-line or graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the program.
Allow users to input text files for compression and decompression.
Compression and Decompression:
Enable users to compress text files using Huffman Coding to achieve significant size reduction.
Implement the functionality to decompress Huffman-encoded files to their original form accurately.
Performance Evaluation:
Conduct benchmarking and performance testing to evaluate the compression ratio and speed of the Huffman Coding implementation compared to other compression methods.
Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling to ensure the program gracefully handles various input scenarios and unexpected situations.
Documentation:
Create comprehensive documentation that explains the project's architecture, algorithms, data structures, and how to use the software.
Presentation:
Prepare a presentation or report summarizing the project's objectives, methodologies, results, and potential future improvements.
Skills and Knowledge Developed:
Proficiency in data structures and algorithms, particularly binary trees and priority queues.
Strong coding skills in a programming language of choice (e.g., Python, C++, Java).
Understanding of file handling and input/output operations.
Knowledge of bitwise operations for efficient encoding and decoding.
Ability to analyze and optimize the performance of a compression algorithm.
Presentation and documentation skills to effectively convey project details and findings.
