# Huffman_Compression
Huffman Coding is a fundamental data compression technique used in various applications to reduce the size of data files efficiently. This Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) project aims to implement the Huffman Coding algorithm from scratch, demonstrating a deep understanding of the underlying concepts in data compression.
